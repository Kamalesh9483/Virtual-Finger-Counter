# Virtual-Gesture-controlled-actuation-using-stm32F401RE
Used the Python MediaPipe Hands firmware to detect the finger landmarks and the finger count.
These finger count details are sent to the STM32F401RE through serial communication.
The firmware written in STM32F would detect these counts and produce corresponding actuation of motor.
